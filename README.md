In the Business Case project, various machine learning models were evaluated to determine their classification effectiveness. 
AdaBoost emerged as the top performer with an impressive F1 score of 82%, showcasing a strong balance between precision and recall. 
Following closely were KNN with an F1 score of 77% and XGBoost at 76%. 
Other models like Random Forest 75% and SVM 75% also demonstrated solid performance. 
Based on these results, AdaBoost is recommended for implementation due to its robustness. 
Future work could focus on fine-tuning this model or exploring ensemble techniques to further enhance performance.
